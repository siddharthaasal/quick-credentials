        "strength": "To lead and take initiative have been among my biggest strengths. I’ve led multiple academic research projects in college and guided my teams to the finals of several hackathons. I’ve consistently been able to keep the team focused under pressure and ensure we deliver quality results.",
        "weakness": "One area I’m working on is my tendency to take on too much at once — especially when I’m excited by multiple projects. While this drive helps me learn quickly, it can sometimes lead to delays. I’m learning to prioritize better and manage my bandwidth more effectively to ensure consistent output.",
        "description": "Hi, I’m Siddharth Aasal, a final-year Computer Science student at Chandigarh University with hands-on experience across frontend, backend, and blockchain development. I’ve been a finalist in several national hackathons and completed a blockchain summer program with Metacrafters, where I built dApps, custom Tokens, and NFT bridges using React, JavaScript, and Solidity. My recent projects include an image encryption tool and a blockchain-based certificate manager—both built with React, TypeScript, and Vite."

            "what_i_did": "As part of the Summer Blockchain Program by Metacrafters, I built multiple decentralized applications (dApps) across Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon. I created an Ethereum-based dApp enabling users to perform transactions via MetaMask, integrated custom ERC-20 token logic, and explored smart contract interaction flows. I also developed a basic NFT bridge prototype to simulate cross-chain NFT transfers using token metadata replication. Throughout the program, I worked extensively with Solidity, Hardhat, Remix, and Web3.js, gaining real-world experience in deploying and interacting with smart contracts, optimizing gas usage, and designing user flows for Web3 applications."
